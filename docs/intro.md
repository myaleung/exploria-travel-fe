# Travel Info Web Application Challenge - Challenge 4

## Introduction

DFCorp are interested in expanding their portfolio of applications that you have been developing.  Their latest idea is a web-based travel information application.  The initial requirement is to display a 5 day weather forecast for any searchable location with the functionality to be able to save favourite locations locally.  In addition to this they have further requirements to fulfil, if you have time, with these being a map of the local area and a slide show of local hotels.  They hope that this will encourage the users of their current apps to use this service and see potential for integration into other apps that they have in design.

### Benefits

- **Personalised User Experience:** Users will be able to log into their own personal accounts where they can save their location bookmarks and have the information stored on the database. This would lead to enhanced engagement on the platform regularly.
- **User Authentication:** Robust user authentication methods can be implemented to protect user accounts.
- **Weather Information Enquiry:** Users will get a 5-day forecast to know what to pack for their trip and be aware of the weather for the next 5-days.

### Impact

- **User Retention and Growth:** A personalised and seamless experience can lead to higher user retention and attract new users.
- **Brand Reputation:** This new feature enhances the brand's portfolio and builds upon their reputation.
- **Revenue:** This new feature and investment could open up new revenue streams such as targeted advertising and/or premium features for account holders.

### Risks

- **Security Breaches:** Storing user data centrally increases the risk of data breaches.
- **Data Compliance:** Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations (e.g. GDPR) can be complex and costly.

### Conclusion
The travel app is able to accurately retrieve 5-day weather forecasts from the weather API and display them in a well structured format that follows the wireframe. Users are able to create and log into their personal accounts where they'll be able to save favourited locations they plan to travel to in the future and easily gain access to the location's forecasts.

An edge case of users searching for weather has been implemented and also address the issue when they may copy and paste the URL into a new browser or if they look to share it with others in their party.
